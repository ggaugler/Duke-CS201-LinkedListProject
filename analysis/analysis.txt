In answering these questions you should refer to the timings you generated from the 
DNABenchmark program on your machine. Use these timings to answer three questions.

Question 1: are the benchmark timings for StringStrand consistent with the explanation 
below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(b2S)? 

Note that the value of b is half the number of calls to append since each cut (except the first) 
is modeled by two calls of append in the method cutAndSplice -- see the code. 
This means that b2 will be constant in the benchmark, but S will vary. 

Question 2: are the benchmark timings for StringBuilderStrand consistent with the 
explanation below that the time to execute cutAndSplice is O(bS)? 

Note that the value of b is half the number of calls to append since each cut (except the first) 
is modeled by two calls of append in the method cutAndSplice -- see the code. 
This means that b will be constant in the benchmark, but S will vary. 

Question 3: Explain why the time for LinkStrand does not change much at all over all 
the runs in the benchmark program. Explain why you think memory is exhausted at 
the specific strand size you see in your timings -- as compared to 
exhaustion for String and StringBuilder.
